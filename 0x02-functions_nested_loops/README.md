# Funcions, Nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and  nested loops in **C language**

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

##Files
All of the following files are program written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-putchar.c` | Prints `Putchar` |
| `1-alphabet.` | Prints the alphabet in lower case |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | Prints 10 times the alphabet |
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for lower case character |
| `4-isalpha.c` | Checks for alphabetic character |
| `5-sign.c` | prints the 9 times table, starting with 0 |
| `10-add.c` | Adds two integer and returns the result |
| `11-print_to_98.c` | Prints all natural number from `n` to `98` |
| `100-times_table` | Prints the `n` times table, starting with 0 |
